### A forum made to learn Django

It's pretty ugly because I'm learning Django, so UI/UX design is useless

### Contributing

```bash
$ git clone repo
$ cd django-learnproject
$ pip -r requirements.txt # Depends on your installation
$ ./manage.py migrate # Also depends on your installation
$ ./manage.py runserver
```
